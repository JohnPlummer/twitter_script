CONSUMER_KEY and CONSUMER_SECRET ENV vars need to be set on Heroku. To
run the app locally create config/heroku.env.rb with the following
content (don't forget to add to .gitignore)

  # This file contains the ENV vars necessary to run the app locally.  
  # They should be set as ENV vars on Heroku.
  # Some of these values are sensitive, and some are developer specific.
  #
  # DO NOT CHECK THIS FILE INTO VERSION CONTROL

  ENV['CONSUMER_KEY']       = 'ImJpVe3t4HG1H81kmHMHw'
  ENV['CONSUMER_SECRET']    = 'LH6w1APk9TzEcDsQQyICxU9VVw37DyzvFN0Kyw8M'
